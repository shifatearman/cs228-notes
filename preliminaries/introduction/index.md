The thing I appreciate most in someone is predictability. It's hard to deal with unpredictable people. The same joke that made an unpredictable person laugh one day, might make him sad on another day.  That's a lot of calculation for someone to do. If someone is predictably honest - that's great. Unpredictability may come in many form. If someone is predictably dishonest - well that's great too. You don't have to do a lot of mental calculation to decide how he will do something. But if someone is unpredictable when it comes to honesty - that's a serious problem. He is sometimes honest, sometimes dishonest.
